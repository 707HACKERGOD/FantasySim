FantasySim (wip title) is a Python 2d cozy social sim I vibe-code in gemini for fun when bored.

You can observe a small virtual town of 16 characters, customize them and play as any of them.

Roadmap:

- ✅ Day/Night cycle
- 🚧 Professions with unique varying schedules, hiring logic
- Conversations system for 2+ participants with a texting-app-like UI and focus on "reply" mechanic where different personalities get different options for which messages they can reply to
- Activities system for 2+ participants: walks, beach volleyball, dates
- Randomized personalities (MBTI, astrology, backstories) that define schedules and interactions
- Character creation
- A LOT more dialogue options depending on personality
- Relationships system that adds a new factor on top of all existing systems above
- Custom player/NPC interactions like unlimited following ???

- Save file manager
- Immersive town with custom pixel art and sound effects depending on where you are
- Custom character sprites with randomized appearences
- Weather and seasons
- "God mode" for creating custom NPCs and switching between them
- Global events in the town: seasonal and random
